## Overview

`dfidx` is a small `R` package which is intended to deal efficiently
with data frames when each observation is identified by a combination
of values of two variables (indexes). `dfidx` exports the function
`dfidx` which takes as main argument a data frame and returns a
`dfidx` object and the `idx`/`idx_name` functions which respectively
return one or all of the indexes and their names. Methods are provided
for `R`'s extractors and for some of `dplyr`'s verbs. 

## Installation

`dfidx` is not currently available on `CRAN`. Use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ycroissant/dfidx")
